ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \\n\\n7\\n\\nActivity-Based Management\\n\\nActivity-based management (ABM) is a discipline that \\n\\nfocuses on the management of activities as the route \\n\\nto improving organizational performance and the value \\n\\nreceived by its customers.\\n\\n \\n\\n8\\n\\nActivity-Based Costing\\n\\nActivity-based costing (ABC)\\n\\n  is a methodology to calculate \\n\\nthe cost of activities (such as \\n\\ntraining employees) and cost \\n\\nobjects (such as products \\n\\nand services) within an \\n\\norganization\\n\\n  provides a focus on activities \\n\\nnot visible through traditional \\n\\naccounting.\\n\\nAdapted from The CAM-I Glossary of \\nActivity-Based Management, Edited by \\nNorm Raffish and Peter B.B. Turney, \\n(Arlington: CAM-I, 1991.)\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the late 1980s, ABC became a popular costing tool among manufacturing companies for calculating \\n\\noverhead (indirect) costs.  \\n\\nManufacturing companies became the first to implement ABC because it supplied information for pricing \\n\\nand marketing opportunities. These organizations had expenditures of approximately 70 to 95% indirect \\n\\ncosts.  \\n\\nIn the mid-1990s, ABC expanded into the ABM management tool, and it became popular among services \\n\\nindustries because those organizations’ cost structure consists of more than 90% indirect.  \\n\\nToday, ABM is widely used across all agencies, including government.  \\n\\n\\n\\n1-6 Chapter 1  Introduction to Activity-Based Modeling \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Optimizing \\n\\nresources is key to their survival. \\n\\nAligning Activities to the Strategic Plan \\n\\nABC does not replace traditional cost systems. Traditional cost systems must continue to provide the \\n\\ntraditional cost information necessary for financial reporting to shareholders, for government agencies, \\n\\nand for resource management.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n 1.1  An Overview of Activity-Based Management and Activity-Based Costing 1-7 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \\n\\n10\\n\\nWhere to Take Action?\\n\\nDo you take action by cutting costs, eliminating resources, \\n\\nor identifying those activities that can be improved to \\n\\nproduce greater income for the organization? \\n\\nWhere ever you take action, ABM\\n\\n  points to areas to improve\\n\\n  identifies causes of cost\\n\\n  provides feedback to monitor improvement efforts\\n\\n  provides information for comparing activities \\n\\n(benchmarking).\\n\\nABM Supports Continuous Improvement\\n\\n \\n\\nThe answer is in identifying activities for improvement. Use SAS Activity-Based Management to \\n\\ncontinuously improve processes and activities to eliminate waste, improve productivity, reduce cycle  \\n\\nand response time, and improve quality.  \\n\\nContinuous and radical improvement is required to effectively and efficiently meet or exceed changing \\n\\ncustomer requirements. \\n\\nActivities are what organizations do to convert resources to products and services. A logically related \\n\\ngroup of activities that accomplish a common specific objective is called a process. \\n\\nActivities have a hierarchy within an organization. Processes consist of smaller activities, which include \\n\\nsmaller tasks. A step further would be to break tasks down into steps. \\n\\nThe ABC model should contain activities. Tasks are too much detail, while processes are too broad. \\n\\nFollow the 5-50 rule: If an activity consumes less than 5% of your time, it is too detailed for the model.  \\n\\nIf it consumes more than 50% of your time, you should break it down for more detail. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n1-8 Chapter 1  Introduction to Activity-Based Modeling \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Goals \\n\\na.   Identify activity-based management components of your organization. \\n\\nb.   Identify two or more outputs in your organization. \\n\\nc.   Identify three activities that support each of the outputs. \\n\\nd.   Prioritize the activities for process improvement. What criteria will you use? \\n\\n2.   Instructions \\n\\na.   Read the case study for Parcel Express. \\n\\nb.   Work with the instructor to create a simple white board model. After completing the model, meet \\n\\nin groups to share your results. \\n\\nCompany Background: \\n\\nParcel Express began operations in Beaverton, Oregon, in 2000 as a ground parcel delivery service.  \\n\\nIn 2005, with 125 employees and $1 million in sales, the company began expanding to overnight delivery \\n\\nand 2nd day delivery.  \\n\\nThe existing accounting system, which divides the business into about ten product groupings, fails to \\n\\nreflect the different costs of doing business for the two express services: Overnight Express and 2nd Day \\n\\nGuaranteed. Management wants to know how each product is performing and how its marketing efforts \\n\\ncan be improved. \\n\\nThe goal is to trace marketing costs to individual services so that the overall cost and profit of each \\n\\nservice can be determined and improved. In 2011, total sales revenue was $47 million.  \\n\\nParcel Express also wants to meet a target profit margin of at least 25% for both products. \\n\\nPhase I — Costing Activities and Services \\n\\nSalaries are $20 million for 2011. This includes all salaries and benefits recorded in the general ledger. \\n\\nExpenses are rolled up into one account called Operating Expenses. In 2011, operating expenses are $16 \\n\\nmillion. The following information determines the activity costs for branch collection, regional sorting, \\n\\ntracking, and delivery. \\n\\n\\n\\n 1.2  The Fundamentals of an Activity-Based Model 1-19 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Branch \\n\\ncollection expenditures also include the cost of equipment, fuel, and personnel to haul packages. \\n\\nOf the costs, 75% are for Overnight Express, and 25% are for 2nd Day Guaranteed. \\n\\nRegional Sorting \\n\\nRegional sorting has two components: sorting and inspecting. These costs include the costs for machinery \\n\\nand personnel.   \\n\\nParcel Express sorts 60,000 packages each year for Overnight Express distributors and 40,000 packages \\n\\nfor 2nd Day Guaranteed. \\n\\nTracking \\n\\nTracking and reimbursement expenses are incurred when products are delayed and/or lost. It takes about \\n\\nthe same amount of effort to track an Overnight Express package and a 2nd Day Guaranteed package.  \\n\\nThis year, they tracked the following number of packages: \\n\\n  3000 for Overnight Express \\n\\n  2000 for 2nd Day Guaranteed \\n\\n\\n\\n1-20 Chapter 1  Introduction to Activity-Based Modeling \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Cube Explorer\\n\\nEach type of analysis provides a unique view \\n\\nof a model’s dimensional intersections. \\n\\n \\n\\nThere are three ways to analyze model data in OLAP: \\n\\nCube Explorer  \\n\\nUse the Cube Explorer when you are analyzing Multi-Stage Contributions cubes. The Cube Explorer \\n\\nenables you to reveal your entire drill-down path to quickly uncover relationships that typically lie hidden \\n\\nin complex data. \\n\\nGrid View \\n\\nGrid view enables you to analyze data using a pivot table style grid. The Grid and Chart views can  \\n\\nbe linked or viewed separately. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.1  The SAS Activity-Based Management Workspaces 2-11 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \\n\\nChart View \\n\\nAs you build a Grid view, the data is also displayed in a chart. You can hide or show the chart. The \\n\\ninformation within the Grid or Chart view is derived from the model data and structure. There are many \\n\\nuser-selectable chart types available on the chart page.  \\n\\n14\\n\\nThe Reports Workspace \\n\\nAnnotations, mark-ups, and \\n\\ncomments can be added to \\n\\nreports. They can be saved, as \\n\\nwell as published, for other report \\n\\nusers.\\n\\n \\n\\nYou can access the Reports home page either from  \\n\\n  the Reports button at the bottom of the Navigation Pane \\n\\n  the Workspace Manager. \\n\\nFrom the Reports home page, you can create, publish, configure, or delete a report. \\n\\n15\\n\\n5. The Contributions Workspace\\nThe contributions query provides a fast and \\n\\neasy method to view cost flows throughout \\n\\na model. You can query contributions without \\n\\ngenerating a cube. \\n\\nQuery example\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n2-12 Chapter 2  Exploring SAS® Activity-Based Management \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

In the example above, additional dimensions could \\n\\nbe added to increase the level of detail.  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3-4 Chapter 3  Elements of Model Structure \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Three or more dimensions add data to the model  \\n\\nand to the account intersections. Intersections A and B, A and C, and B and C can be analyzed. \\n\\nThe modules in SAS Activity-Based Management provide the simplest example of intersections. Yet each \\n\\nof these modules will have many dimensions.  \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.2  Building Model Structure 3-5 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

The Resource module contains cost data \\n\\nfrom the organization. These costs flow into the Activity \\n\\nand Cost Object modules.\\n\\nA fourth module, External Units, is provided but is not \\n\\nused in all model designs.\\n\\nResource\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nCost Object\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3-6 Chapter 3  Elements of Model Structure \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \\n\\n10\\n\\nDimensions for the Resource Module\\n\\nThe New Model Wizard: Resource Module Example\\n\\nTypical dimensions for the Resource \\n\\nModule are the Organization and General \\n\\nLedger. Each of these dimensions will \\n\\nhold dimension members as roll-up \\n\\naccounts.\\n\\nBasic dimensions are provided in each module in the New Model Wizard \\n\\nand you can create your own. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe primary purpose of the Resource module is to be the starting point for an ABM analysis. Its value \\n\\ncomes from the relationship of resources to activities and cost objects.  \\n\\nHowever, it is important to construct the Resource module to be familiar to users and to mirror the \\n\\norganization.  \\n\\nEvery transactional account system has a chart of accounts reflecting the company’s classification  \\n\\nand categorization of expenditures. It provides the basis for the Account dimension. Two portions of this \\n\\ndocument deserve special attention: accounts and organization. These two portions are natural dimensions \\n\\nfor use in ABM modeling. \\n\\nGL accounts describe how to reference and name all accounts. Focusing on an account, the reference \\n\\nconsists of two or more digits. Usually, this reference forms a hierarchy. In a typical well-formed chart  \\n\\nof accounts, a company might use three digits to reference an account. \\n\\nABM modeling should be at the level of similar cost behavior rather than cost classification.  \\n\\nWhen GL accounts are combined with an organizational code, all expenses are completely and uniquely \\n\\ncategorized.  \\n\\nCommon names for the organizational front line are department and cost center. Governmental \\n\\norganizations might also use division and branch. In practice, people work together in a department  \\n\\nto do some common or similar work. In doing so, they incur expenses, which are described by accounts. \\n\\nA department’s expenses use a subset of accounts that depends on the nature of the work and the expenses \\n\\nincurred. Rarely would a department use all GL accounts.  \\n\\nTypically, these departments are organized by location and then function and finally by department. Many \\n\\norganizations might have even more organizational levels depending on their size and complexity. \\n\\nFor ABM modeling, organizational hierarchy forms a natural Organization dimension. It is best used  \\n\\nas the first dimension in the Resource module, although it must be adapted to the actual organization. \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.2  Building Model Structure 3-7 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \\n\\n11\\n\\nDimensions for the Activity Module\\n\\nThe New Model Wizard: Activity Module Example\\n\\nTypical dimensions for the Activity \\n\\nmodule are:\\n\\n  the Organization/Region dimension \\n\\n(the same dimension defined for the \\n\\nResource module can be applied \\n\\nto the Activity module) \\n\\n  the Activity/Process dimension.\\n\\n \\n\\nActivities are the essence of the activity-based methodology. Activities are what people, machines,  \\n\\nand, sometimes, facilities do. They imply action or work. Processes are groups of activities with a \\n\\ncommon outcome or output.  \\n\\nAn ABM model can be structured so that process analysis naturally flows from its structure. First, \\n\\nhowever, as with the Resource module, it is important to construct the Activity module so that  \\n\\nit is familiar to users and mirrors the organization. \\n\\nAn excellent modeling approach preserves the responsibility of the department manager by permitting  \\n\\na view to the activities and the cost of the activities performed in that department. Because the \\n\\norganization dimension was also used for the Resource module, it is already defined for the Activity \\n\\nmodule. \\n\\nBecause activities are the building blocks of business processes, it follows that activities and processes \\n\\ncan share a common hierarchy with processes forming the upper or more summary levels and activities \\n\\nforming the lower or more detailed levels.  \\n\\n\\n\\n3-8 Chapter 3  Elements of Model Structure \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Others might also \\n\\nbe required for complex organizations. Each of these dimensions implies its own hierarchy. The \\n\\ncombination of these dimensions uniquely identifies the lowest analytical item in the module. \\n\\nThe intersections for the Customers and Product dimensions represent Cost Object accounts. \\n\\n13\\n\\nAdding Dimension Members\\n\\nOnce the dimensions are created in the New Model \\n\\nwizard, the application takes you to the Dimensions page. \\n\\nHere dimension members are added to the primary \\n\\ndimensions.\\n\\nDimensions Dimension Members\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.2  Building Model Structure 3-9 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Launch the New Account Wizard to add \\n\\naccounts and entered cost elements to the module. \\n\\nOn the first page of the wizard, you must select a unique combination of dimension members that  \\n\\nyou defined on the Dimensions page. This creates the dimensional signature. \\n\\nIn the New Account Wizard, you have the option to create accounts from parent dimension members,  \\n\\nall intersections, or leaf dimension members.  \\n\\n15\\n\\nThe appearance of Dimension Members as Intersection \\n\\nAccounts in the model.\\n\\nAppearance in the Model\\n\\nExample\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3-10 Chapter 3  Elements of Model Structure \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Once the dimensions are created, they cannot be changed. Dimension Members can be added. \\n\\nDimension members are usually represented as a hierarchy. The dimension-level name describes where  \\n\\nin the hierarchy it is located. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe intersection of dimension members becomes the intersection accounts in your model structure. \\n\\nIn the example above, IT is the dimension member of the Organization dimension, and Salaries  \\n\\nis a dimension member of the General Ledger dimension. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.3  Using the NO <Dimension> 3-11 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

It is an instruction for how costs are flowed from \\nan account.  \\n\\n  attempts to accurately measure the consumption of an account or to assign cost to an account. \\n\\n21\\n\\nExample: Evenly Assigned Driver \\n\\nScenario\\n\\n  An organization receives 30 orders from all customers. \\n\\n  Evenly Assigned assigns the same number to all \\n\\nproducts.\\n\\nProduct Evenly Assigned\\n\\nA 1\\n\\nB 1\\n\\n \\n\\nEvenly Assigned – Assigns an account’s costs equally to each destination account.  For example, \\nif you assign an account’s cost to two destination accounts, each receives half of the total cost. \\n\\n\\n\\n5-12 Chapter 5 Creating Assignments \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

The factors are \\n\\ndetermined by a user-defined equation.\\n\\ncontinued...continued...  \\n\\nPercentage – Assigns a specified percentage of an account’s costs to each account that receives costs.  \\n\\nIt tracks the total percentage and reports when 100% is exceeded or not used. \\n\\nWeighted – Contains two factors to represent the relationship between accounts. The first factor measures \\n\\nvolume (or frequency), and the second factor measures intensity. The two factors, multiplied together, \\n\\nproduce a calculated value used to distribute cost. For example, the cost of the activity of processing \\n\\ncustomer orders for delivery depends on the number of orders processed (frequency) multiplied  \\n\\nby the average number of lines per order (intensity). \\n\\nCalculated – Contains more than two factors to represent the relationship between accounts.

In terms \\n\\nof the model, you might want to observe the costs at pre-fabrication, assembly, and inspection. \\n\\nThe next step is to decide whether you want to see the costs as they move into the department or as they \\n\\nleave it.

You can limit the information generated by a report to one item, \\n\\nselected items, or a set of related items. Once you have customized a report template, you can save  \\n\\nthe customization information for later use.  \\n\\nMultiple currency support – several report templates have been defined to allow for two currencies  \\n\\nto be displayed. These reports are supported from the basic report templates. The users experience will  \\n\\nbe to simply walk through the report wizard and select the two currencies to be displayed. \\n\\nProduct costing reporting requirements  \\n\\nThe ability to determine the true product cost is critical for every business. Without understanding the \\n\\ncause and effect relationship between the activities performed and products produced, management effort \\n\\nis squandered. Activity-based product costing gives management the tools to attack the bottom line. \\n\\nSAS ABM reporting improves your business by: \\n\\n  Focusing on leading rather than lagging indicators to corporate success \\n\\n  Providing what products truly cost and focusing management efforts \\n\\n  Determining what products you should sell, what is your competitive advantage  \\n\\n  Identifying how you can change your processes to improve costs \\n\\nService costing reporting requirements  \\n\\nUnderstanding the cost behavior of the services your organization delivers is critical to success. Effective \\n\\nmanagement of services depends on understanding the activities required to deliver the services and the \\n\\nrelative costs of those activities. Focus management effort where the greatest impact can be made. \\n\\nSAS ABM reporting improves your business by: \\n\\n  Increasing accountability between the customer demands and the costs incurred \\n\\n  Identifying the cause and effect nature of services and work performed \\n\\n  Determining the activity consumption for services delivered \\n\\n  Providing scenario analysis to evaluate service level alternatives \\n\\nProfitability reporting requirements  \\n\\nThe business challenge is to determine what are the profitable products produced and services delivered. \\n\\nWithout the ability to determine the cause and effect nature of work performed and customer demands, \\n\\nmanagement moves blindly forward. Profitability analysis lights the path to guide the future success. \\n\\nSAS ABM reporting improves your business by: \\n\\n  Determining the most and least profitable product sold \\n\\n  Determining the most profitable customers and market segments served \\n\\n  Facilitating focused strategic marketing to emphasize the profitable products \\n\\n  Steering the corporation process improvement efforts where the benefits are the greatest \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n A.2  Report Templates A-5 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Due to the fact that any account in the model can \\n\\nhave multiple dimensions, an account will be listed multiple times, once in each dimension being \\n\\nreviewed. Thus, in the resource module in the Rushmore example, there is a GL account dimensional \\n\\nperspective and an organizational dimensional perspective. The big key here is that dimensions are \\n\\nnot only for profitability anymore. They give us real power in analysis through  \\n\\nall parts of the model. \\n\\n \\n\\n4.   Dimensional attribute unit cost \\n\\nThis report is the same as the Dimensional Attribute Report except that it displays costs on a Unit cost \\n\\nbasis. This report would be most effective when analyzing the Performance metrics for an Activity or \\n\\na process.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nA-8 Appendix A  Report Dependencies \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

This report gives full profitability \\n\\ninformation noting revenue, cost, and profit, sold quantity, unit revenue, unit cost, and unit profit.  \\n\\nThis is a critical report to support management decisions, to understand the true bottom line of your \\n\\norganization based on your activity-based costing model.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n A.2  Report Templates A-9 \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.

Driver cost and rate \\n\\nUser – modeler: for analysis, management for analysis \\n\\nWhy use the report: source accounts that use each driver, the driver quantities, the driver costs  \\n\\nand a unit driver rate. This allows management to see the sensitivity of a model to the changes  \\n\\nin a driver quantity. This could be a crucial part of management’s what-if analysis.

Unassigned costs \\n\\nUser – modeler for validation \\n\\nWhy use the report: this finds why all of the resource costs do not flow to the Products and \\n\\nCustomers. This to find accounts that do not have outgoing assignments, or accounts, which have not \\n\\nbeen used as an internal boc unit on another account.

Unit cost \\n\\nUser – modeler for analysis, management for analysis \\n\\nWhy use the report: this report is most useful in reviewing the product and customer costs in the \\n\\nProducts and Customers module. Total costs to produce a product are less interesting than the \\n\\ncorresponding unit costs. For performance metrics management is interested in what it cost per car to \\n\\nmake Honda’s much more than the total cost making all Hondas for the period. Unit cost analysis can \\n\\nbe very useful, when analyzing the costs to support a customer on a per-order or per-shipment basis.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nA-20 Appendix A  Report Dependencies \\n\\nCopyright © 2016, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA.
